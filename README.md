# ClubReader

## Project Overview
ClubReader is an interactive online book-reading platform built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The platform offers personalized book recommendations, club-based reading experiences, live discussions, and an intuitive chatbot assistant. With separate dashboards for users and administrators, ClubReader enhances the reading experience through a structured and engaging interface.

## Inspiration
As a book enthusiast, I noticed a lack of platforms that integrate all essential reading and community engagement features in one place. From a userâ€™s perspective, I wanted to create a website that not only allows free book reading but also fosters discussions, connections, and shared literary experiences. ClubReader was developed to bridge this gap by providing a space where users can explore their favorite books, engage in meaningful conversations, and build connections with like-minded readers.

## Key Features

### User Dashboard
- Personalized home page based on user preferences selected through an initial survey.
- Access to saved books and the ability to track reading progress.
- Profile customization (profile picture and bio updates).

### Book Reading & Community Features
- Users can read books on the website for free.
- **Club Feature:** Users can create or join clubs to read and discuss books together.
- **Live Chat Forum:** Real-time discussions with club members.
- **Book Ratings & Comments:** Users can rate and comment on books, with a ranking page showcasing the most popular and discussed books.

### Book Management & Requests
- Users can request books from the admin if they are not available on the platform.
- Admins can upload new books, edit book descriptions, and manage book listings.

### Admin Dashboard
- Manage book uploads and edits.
- View, approve, or reject user book requests with reasons provided.
- Monitor user-created clubs and discussions.

### Chatbot Assistance
- Provides website guidance and assists users in navigating features.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS for an intuitive UI/UX.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Database:** MongoDB for efficient data management.
- **Authentication:** Secure login and user authentication using JWT.
